Code for our modeling

TO USE: Run Java program. Enter a DNA sequence (sequence length must be a mutliple of three). Output will be the probability for each individual amino acid mutating, the average mutation probability for the sequence, and a sequence that has commas separating every third codon (useful for Excel display).
